<ul>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt.</p>
    <p>Stir until well-combined.</p>
    <p>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the pan.</p>
    <p>Bake for 10 minutes until set.</p>
    <p>Remove the pan from the oven and set aside.</p>
    <p>Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.</p>
</ul>
    <li>Make the cheesecake batter.</li>
<ul>
    <p>In the bowl of an elecric mixer, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour.</p>
    <p>Beat on medium speed until just smooth. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined.</p>

</ul>
<li>Pour the batter on top of the crust.</li>

<ul>
    <p>Bake!</p>
    <p>Set the unbaked cheesecake in a large roasting pan.</p>
    <p>Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes about one inch up the side of the cake pan.</p>
    <p>Bake until the cake is just set. This should take one and a half to two hours.</p>
</ul>
<ol>Cool!</ol>
<ul>
<p>Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack.</p>
<p>Cool the cheesecake in a water bath until the water is just warm. This should take about 45 minutes.</p>
